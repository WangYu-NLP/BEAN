# Enhancing Biomedical Named Entity Recognition with Parallel Boundary Detection and Category Classification

This repository contains the code and resources accompanying the paper titled "Enhancing Biomedical Named Entity Recognition with Parallel Boundary Detection and Category Classification." The paper present a novel parallel BioNER model, Bean, which aims to address the unique properties of biomedical entities while achieving a reasonable balance between handling nested structures and incorporating category correlations.

More details to be updated soon.
