# Enhancing Biomedical Named Entity Recognition with Parallel Boundary Detection and Category Classification

This repository contains the code and resources accompanying the paper titled "Enhancing Biomedical Named Entity Recognition with Parallel Boundary Detection and Category Classification." The paper present a novel parallel BioNER model, Bean, which aims to address the unique properties of biomedical entities while achieving a reasonable balance between handling nested structures and incorporating category correlations.

## Datasets
Five public NER benchmark datasets are used in this work. Three datasets involve nested entities: GENIA and Chilean Waiting List in biomedical domain, and ACE 2005 in general domain; two flat NER datasets in biomedical domain, i.e., JNLPBA and NCBI Disease. Download dataset here:
